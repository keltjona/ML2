# Employee Attrition Prediction Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for predicting employee attrition using multiple machine learning models.

## Features

- ðŸ”® **Prediction Interface**: Input employee data and get attrition predictions
- ðŸ“Š **Model Comparison**: Compare performance of different ML models
- ðŸ“ˆ **Data Insights**: Visualize attrition patterns and correlations
- ðŸ”„ **Model Selection**: Choose between Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare Models**

   If you already have trained models:
   - Place your trained models in the `models/` directory
   - Ensure your preprocessing pipeline is saved as `preprocessing_pipeline.pkl`

   If you need to create demo models:
   ```bash
   python model_saver.py
   ```

3. **Run the Dashboard**

   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

   This will start the Streamlit server and open the dashboard in your web browser.

## Dashboard Sections

1. **Prediction Tab**
   - Input employee information
   - Select a model for prediction
   - View prediction results and risk factors

2. **Model Comparison Tab**
   - Compare performance metrics across models
   - View visual comparison of model performance
   - Read model descriptions and recommendations

3. **Data Insights Tab**
   - View attrition distribution
   - Explore feature correlations with attrition
   - Understand key factors influencing employee departures

## Usage Notes

- The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for HR professionals to predict attrition risk
- For the most accurate predictions, use the XGBoost model, which typically has the highest performance
- The "Key Risk Factors" section highlights areas where intervention might reduce attrition risk
- All predictions include probability scores to help quantify uncertainty
