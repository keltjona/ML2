# Employee Attrition Prediction Dashboard

This dashboard allows users to predict employee attrition using trained machine learning models.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure that you have your trained models and preprocessing pipeline in the `models` directory:
   - The preprocessing pipeline should be saved as `preprocessing_pipeline.pkl`
   - Models should be saved as `model_name.pkl` (e.g., `logistic_regression.pkl`, `random_forest.pkl`, etc.)

3. Run the dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

## Features

- Predict employee attrition with different ML models
- View model performance metrics
- Explore data insights and correlations
- Interactive interface for inputting employee data
